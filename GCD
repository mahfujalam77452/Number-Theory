//Time complexity of the gde function is O(log(A) + long(B)).
//Here the log function is 10 based.
//The gcd of of there number GCD(a,b,c) can be computed as gcd(gcd(a,b),c).
//gcd(a,b)=gcd(a-b,b)
//To find out the gcd of negative value .we will use only the absolute value of the number s
//Or we will use the absolute value of the return number.
//The gcd of gcd(0,0) is INF.
